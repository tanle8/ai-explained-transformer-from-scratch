# AI Explainled: Transformer from scratch

![Github](https://github.com/tanle8)

Implementation of Transformer from the paper: "Attention is all you need".

This repo belong to a series called **AI Explained**, where I implement well-known AI/ML architectures (Transformer, Vision Transformer, ...) from scratch. The goal is to gain profound understanding of these architectures by implementing, improving from scratch or upon existing explanations and refining my knowledge.
